            <h2>Our Class</h2>
            <p>This project is a part of our INFO 465 - Time, Technology, and Design - class for the winter quarter of
                2023. This course explores time as an element of human life, and how design and technology influences
                how people experience it. Some topics explored include machine time, crip time, temporal tensions,
                Afrofuturism, and music in time. Throughout the course of the quarter, we have each worked to fill an
                80+ page sketchnook with sketches, notes/reflection, and collages.</p>

            <h2>Our Project</h2>
            <p>Our project, Timeless Conversations, is an exploration of people's experiences of time. We interviewed
                and recorded 16 conversations with people of different ages and different cultural backgrounds. Using
                these conversations, we built a podcast exploring our interview questions and how our interviewees
                answered them.
            </p>
            <p>In our project, time is the centerpiece of all our questions to our interviewees. We sought to see how
                time is perceived differently between individuals.
                This has allowed us to begin understanding others at a deeper level temporally. By gaining this
                understanding, we hope to further reach a level of empathy for how to best work with all different
                experiences of time.
            </p>

            <h3>Kayla</h3>
            <p>During the development and execution of our final project, Timeless Conversations, I learned the
                importance of asking questions while also being a listener. In our course, I gained immense knowledge of
                the idea of mutual learning, which is the process of sharing ideas, values, and backgrounds with one
                another and learning together. One quote from class that stuck with me was, “We're not empty vessels; we
                are going to learn from each other.” The strong sense of community and collaboration in our course
                sparked creativity, leading us to conduct interviews with people from different age ranges and
                backgrounds to learn about their experiences with time.</p>
            <p>As the primary topic of our design course was time, my group and I wanted to explore this idea even
                further and ask questions related to time to people who may have never thought deeply about it. Similar
                to the in-class questions we received every morning at the beginning of class, these simple questions
                related to the time allowed me to have a stronger understanding of how time affects our lives every day.
            </p>
            <p>During the podcast interview process, I interviewed four participants: two elementary school students,
                one college student, and one mother. Though my interview participants knew about the concepts of time,
                the interview questions allowed them to think more deeply about these simple questions. Gradually, as I
                asked more questions during the interviews, I was able to hear more raw and in-depth responses. These
                more in-depth responses meant to me that my interviewees were more comfortable with the idea of time.
            </p>
            <p>As a group member, I personally think I did well at coordinating with my team, opening up and sharing
                ideas, and also keeping our team on track. Because I was working with group members that I have known
                for a while now, it was easy to establish team goals and complete our project. Being a group member to
                me means taking initiative, keeping my group members engaged, and also making sure I am available to
                work with my team. What I can do better next time would be to be proactive in reminding myself and team
                members about project deliverables and creating clear goals at the beginning of a project.</p>
