            <div>
                <h2>Project Milestone 1: The Idea</h2>
                <h3>Why Is This Topic Important?</h3>
                <p>Time is a centerpeice to everyone's lives. We experience it in the way we move about our days, and it is influenced by age and culture. Understanding other people's perceptions of time helps us start to understand other people at a deeper level. We can further reach a level of empathy for how to best work with all different experiences of time.
                </p>
                <h3>What Do We Plan To Do?</h3>
                <p>
                Our project, Timeless Conversations, is an exploration of people’s experiences of time. We plan on recording at least 12 conversations with people of different ages and different cultural backgrounds. These conversations will be used to build either a podcast or video series where we’ll explore questions along the lines of “How do you keep track of time”, “How do you visualize time”, and “How do you feel when you don’t meet a temporal expectation, for example when you’re late for a meeting”. As our interviewees are talking, we’ll have them draw on a piece of paper in front of them, allowing us to also see how they think and perceive time in a visual way.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Interview Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How do you keep track of time?</li>
                    <li>How do you feel when you miss a deadline or an expectation?</li>
                    <li>How do you feel when you have to wait for somebody?</li>
                    <li>How do you visualize time?</li>
                    <li>Where are you in time right now?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With Gisele’s previous experience of creating podcasts for WINFO, we set our goal deliverable to be a podcast incorporating portions of our interviews with our discussions and reflections. Having read about the importance of slow design and reflection, we found this as a great opportunity to not only interview and learn about other people’s perceptions of time but also come together as a group to reflect and learn from each other.

                <h2>Project Milestone 2: The Timeline</h2>
                <h3>Our Schedule</h3>
                <p>After having our idea, we turned to create a coherent schedule to allow plenty of time to interview our participants, review the interviews, create our reflective talk, and combine it all together into a podcast. This was important since our project relied heavily on scheduling time with other people to interview them. With only four weeks left in the quarter, it was crucial for us to begin reaching out to people. 
                </p>
                <h3>Our Initial Timeline</h3>
                <p>As part of the planning for our project, we created a timeline to ensure that everything would be done on time.</p>
                <h3>The Week-by-Week Schedule</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Week 6 - Reach out to interviewees </li>
                    <li>Week 7 - Conduct interviews </li>
                    <li>Week 8 - Outline narrative of conversation</li>
                    <li>Week 9 - Record our conversation and edit the podcast for an MVP </li>
                    <li>Week 10 - Finish the project and finalize details </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Project Milestone 3: The Interviews</h2>
                <h3>Our Update</h3>
                <p>After reaching out to participants, our group worked on conducting interviews using the questions that we ideated in previous weeks. During these interviews, we asked our participants to envision themselves in time and draw out how time relates to them, they answered our questions both verbally and on a piece of paper. Below is the list of people we interviewed. We tried to get  variety of genders, ages, and ethnicities to view a wide range of perceptions of time. Our age range spanned from 9 - 84. After conducting these interviews, our next step is to derive a conversation and a clear narrative surrounding everyone's perception of time. 
                </p>
                <h3>The People</h3>
                <div>

            <div>
                <h2>Project Milestone 4: The Conversation</h2>
                <h3>Narrative Framing</h3>
                <p>After all of the interviews were been conducted, the four of us got together and recorded a conversation, referencing the themes we noticed throughout our interviews, and what people talked/drew about. Our aim was to have this be the base of the podcast, and add in clips from the interviews as supplemental information. </p>
                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                <p>After recording this conversation, our next steps are to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stitch together our interviews and insights into a cohesive podcast</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use editing AI software to help create smooth flow of conversation for podcast by taking out awkward pauses, overlap of speakers, and filler words.</li>
                        <li>Review key insights and areas in conversation where audio quotes could be included</li>
                        <li>Find specified audio clips from interview audio files and integrate them within the podcast</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Upload all visuals created by interviewees into the final project deliverable</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ideate how these visuals and potential additional visual components can be used to create a visual aspect to our deliverable</li>
                    </ul>                    
                </ol>
                <p>We then created the repository for our final project deliverable and ideated about how we would present this information</p>
