            <div>
                <h2>The Idea</h2>
                <p>
                    Time is the core of life. Through this class, our group has further understood how time is
                    experienced through how we move about our days, and is influenced by several factors. The Temporal
                    Tensions activity revealed how different groups perceived tensions in their lives and prioritized
                    those to design products that reduce such tensions. Our group was interested in how different people
                    perceive, experience, and interact with time differently. Given the opportunity to freely and
                    creatively explore time, technology, and design, our group decided to attempt to understand other
                    people's perceptions of time. Through this, we wanted to understand other people at a deeper level
                    to better empathize with and respect their time.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Initial Plan</h3>
                <p>
                    Through discussion, we settled on a path for our project, A Timeless Conversation. We sought to
                    explore different people's experiences of time through conversations with a diverse range of people.
                    In hopes of creating visual content of some sort, we decided to have our interviewees draw on a
                    piece of paper during the conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Gisele's previous experience of creating podcasts for WINFO, we set our goal deliverable to be
                    a podcast incorporating portions of our interviews with our discussions and reflections. Having read
                    about the importance of slow design and reflection, we found this as a great opportunity to not only
                    interview and learn about other people's perceptions of time but also come together as a group to
                    reflect and learn from each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creating a podcast would allow our group to explore concepts learned from this class in a different
                    medium than other classes. We all discussed how other classes often asked for papers, presentations,
                    or prototypes to showcase our learnings from the course. As a group, we agreed on wanting to create
                    and work on a unique medium to showcase our knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point in the quarter, we were still trying to gauge the scale of our project. How many
                    interviewees would be appropriate? How could we balance the workload with other commitments? After
                    discussing each other's schedules with each other, we settled on committing to complete an average
                    of four interviews. Considering our goal was to hear from a diverse group of people, we each worked
                    to identify four unique individuals from different cultural backgrounds, age groups, and genders.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Questions</h3>
                <p>
                    Approaching our conversations from a semi-structured to fully-structured interview, our group
                    ideated five main questions that would guide us in the interview process. These questions were kept
                    broad to allow people to interpret and answer freely to better gain a sense of the person's
                    interaction and experience with time. We also chose to give each interviewee a blank sheet of paper
                    so that they could write down and sketch their thoughts over the course of the interview.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How do you keep track of time?</li>
                    <li>How do you feel when you miss a deadline or an expectation?</li>
                    <li>How do you feel when you have to wait for somebody?</li>
                    <li>How do you visualize time?</li>
                    <li>Where are you in time right now?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>The Timeline</h2>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-4">
                        <p>
                            After having our idea, we turned to create a coherent schedule to allow plenty of time to
                            interview
                            our participants, review the interviews, create our reflective talk, and combine it all
                            together
                            into a podcast. This was important since our project relied heavily on scheduling time with
                            other
                            people to interview them. With only four weeks left in the quarter, it was crucial for us to
                            begin
                            reaching out to people.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Week-by-Week Schedule</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Week 6 - Reach out to interviewees </li>
                            <li>Week 7 - Conduct interviews </li>
                            <li>Week 8 - Outline narrative of conversation</li>
                            <li>Week 9 - Record our conversation and edit the podcast for an MVP </li>
                            <li>Week 10 - Finish the project and finalize details </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-8">
                        <img src="./img/story/Timeline-Spread.jpg" alt="project timeline" />
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Having ideated four individuals to interview, we shared the cultural, age, and gender backgrounds of
                    our interviewees with each other to ensure that we covered a diverse range of people. While we were
                    unable to capture every possible group, considering the time we had left and our schedules, we
                    agreed that we had gathered a decent diversity of people.
                </p>
                <h3>Further Refining Our Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    We discussed what would be necessary to create a high-quality podcast: interview audios that were
                    clear and captured the interviewee's thoughts. To help us identify clips from the audio that capture
                    key quotes from our interviews, we also discussed creating transcripts of our interviews. These
                    interviews (with their respective audio and visual elements) served as our main focus for the
                    following weeks.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>The Interviews</h2>
                <p>
                    After reaching out to participants, our group worked on conducting interviews using the questions
                    that we ideated in previous weeks. During these interviews, we asked our participants to envision
                    themselves in time and draw out how time relates to them, they answered our questions both verbally
                    and on a piece of paper. Throughout the interview period, our group kept each other updated on the
                    great insight and thoughts we were hearing from our interviewees that we could incorporate into our
                    final conversation.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Interviewees</h3>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-4">
                        <p>
                            We kept track of our interviewees (including their demographics) in a Google Spreadsheet to
                            keep
                            each other updated on the progress of our interviews. This allowed us to stay communicative
                            with
                            each other to better understand each other's progress.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-8">
                        <img src="./img/story/Interviewee-List.png" alt="The people we interviewed" />
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>To the Conversation</h3>
                <p>
                    The interview process took longer than expected, as scheduling with other people to conduct these
                    conversations served difficult during the quarter. Furthermore, with a smaller set of questions, we
                    realized that conversations ranged from five minutes to 15 minutes. Through this, the need for a
                    reflection by us to serve as the main audio part that would guide the podcast became clear. Thus we
                    began scheduling a time for the group the meet and converse on the insights and thoughts received
                    from our interviewees to create a podcast narrating different people's perceptions of time based on
                    our questions.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>The Conversation</h2>
                <p>
                    We met as a group to reflect on our interviews to frame the base of our podcast. During this time,
                    we also discussed the next steps in how we wanted to approach our final product.
                </p>
                <h3>Narrative Framing</h3>
                <p>
                    After all of the interviews were been conducted, the four of us got together and recorded a
                    conversation, referencing the themes we noticed throughout our interviews, and what people
                    talked/drew about. Our aim was to have this be the base of the podcast and add clips from the
                    interviews as supplemental information.
                </p>
                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                <p>After recording this conversation, our next steps were to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stitch together our interviews and insights into a cohesive podcast</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We began looking into AI podcast editing software that would help create a smooth flow of
                            conversation for the podcast by taking out awkward pauses, overlapping of speakers, and
                            filler words.</li>
                        <li>We began looking at key insights and areas in the conversation where audio from interviews
                            could be included.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Ideate how to include visuals created by interviewees in our final project deliverable.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We realized that creating a video component would not be feasible with the skills that the
                            group had. Thus, we agreed to ideate and discuss other ways to showcase the drawings created
                            by our interviewees as well as reflect our design knowledge. </li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>The Visuals</h2>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-7">
                        <p>
                            Considering many of our group members had experience with working on front-end coding, we
                            settled on a website page to host our visual content, podcast audio, and written reflections
                            through simple HTML and CSS. We sketched out how this site could look like visually.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Podcast Cover Art</h3>
                        <p>
                            We ideated how to approach the podcast cover art, which could be done through Canva.
                            Considering the
                            15-second self-portraits done in class, we decided to do portraits of each other to create
                            our
                            podcast cover art. Not only would this create an additional visual component to our project,
                            but
                            would allow us as students to reflect on our growth as artists in drawing each other.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Different Pages</h3>
                        <p>
                            However, upon creating the site and hearing about the storytelling aspect that would be
                            required, we
                            decided to create several pages within the website to space out the information and avoid
                            having too
                            much text on one page.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-5">
                        <img src="./img/story/HTML-Sketch.jpg" alt="website wireframe" />

            <div>
                <h2>The Final Product</h2>
                <p>
                    As the quarter picked up in the final weeks we did our best to work on finalizing our project. Kayla
                    created a document outlining the necessary to-dos to accomplish our goal product. Gisele led the
                    podcast-creation process, while Emiri and Roshni worked on the repository to create a visual place
                    to showcase our project.
                </p>
                <h3>The Podcast</h3>
                <p>
                    The podcast-creation process was led by Gisele, who showcased how the podcast would be approached to
                    allow other group members to know what kind of interview audio would be necessary. During this time,
                    Kayla listened to our conversation to identify who's audio we needed for which questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We each went through our interview audios to find timestamps of interviewees answering our questions
                    and providing insight. Since there we did not use a collaborative platform to work on the podcast,
                    this would be done all by Gisele. However, by providing timestamps and important quotes to include,
                    the other group members could ease the workload.

                    Since we envisioned our podcast being an upbeat and happy tone, we wanted to add background music to
                    encourage this. We looked into free music libraries that provided upbeat music to include in our
                    podcast. Furthermore, we recorded a short intro to the podcast to make it more cohesive and
                    professional.

                <h3>The Repository</h3>
                <p>
                    After creating a git repository for our final project deliverable, Emiri began coding out the visual
                    look of the site using previous knowledge from front-end development classes. With the help of
                    Kayla's design aesthetic to create a color palette, the design and theme of the site were developed.
                    The different components of our project and descriptions of our project were added to reflect our
                    thought process and lessons learned through the process.

                    Considering the podcast took the longest amount of time to complete, other portions of the project
                    (visuals, descriptions, reflections, and stories) were added to the site prior to the podcast. This
                    was mainly done by Emiri, Kayla, and Roshni as Gisele focused on creating and finalizing our
                    podcast. Our project was completed after reviewing and inserting the podcast audio.
