            <h2>Emiri</h2>
            <p>Through these interviews, I learned that people perceive time differently based on their experiences and
                how they grew up. This built off of several activities we did in class. For example, in the design
                studio for temporal tensions, different groups created different designs that reflected temporal
                tensions specific to them. Each tension explored was unique, reflecting how the variety of perceptions
                of time impacted people's feelings of temporal tensions. </p>
            <p>I also learned that simple conversations about time can reveal a lot about the person themselves, but
                also allow the person to reflect on a unique matter. Many of my interviewees realized that they have
                never thought about time in such a way. Since each person's perception of time is normal to them, people
                fail to recognize that they perceive time this way. Connecting this back to the slow design concept
                explored in class, this allowed me to provide a space for people to slow down and reflect on their
                experiences with time. In turn, this allowed me to reflect on my interviewees, group members, their
                interviewees, and my own perceptions of time. </p>
            <p>A portion of our project asked interviewees to draw out what they were thinking throughout the interview.
                Watching this experience related to several takeaways we had in our final class sessions, as well as
                Emily's presentation during class on her Zine. Even though each person was asked the same questions,
                they all drew different things and had different actions while drawing them. Some people felt more
                comfortable with color, while others stuck to a singular color. Some drew big, while others drew small.
                Through this, I got to experience how different people react to being asked to draw and reflect,
                especially adults who don't have the opportunity to do it much anymore.</p>
            <p>As a group member, I think I did a good job taking the initiative and a lead in parts of the project that
                I felt were lacking work. We had a couple of people already on the podcast portion, but I realized that
                we needed to be working on the HTML files and creating the visual part of our work. Once the GitHub was
                created, I quickly went to work creating a basic outline of the HTML file and styling so that we could
                start filling them in with information and text that was necessary. With the help of Kayla, we created a
                consistent color scheme to use as well.</p>
            <p>I also looked into how we could creatively include the drawings by our interviewees into the HTML and
                site by looking at the carousel component. I worked to resize each image submitted by my team members to
                help make this visually appealing and consistent. Since each image size was different, I spent time
                doing tedious work to resize them into the slides for the carousel. </p>
            <p>Next time, I could better create and maintain a schedule for working on the project. As we got later into
                the quarter, I got busy with my other classes, especially Capstone, which caused me to need to catch up
                in working on the group project for this class. To avoid this, we should have set up more consistent
                meetings and checked in with each other to spread the work out more evenly. </p>
            <h2>Roshni</h2>
                <p>Throughout the process of creating this project, I was able to spend more time thinking about how I perceive time and how that is reflected in the way that I plan and go about my day. When I first talked to my group, I knew we wanted to have something that was representative of different cultures, and I was able to see myself reflected in the people I interviewed. Another thing that I learned about was how different people’s occupations affect their views of time. Looing at the insights from interviews, I found it interesting how students and children had a more fluid understanding of time that was based in more immediate metrics like “here is what I am doing right now” and as people got older and entered the workforce or joined the military, their perceptions of time became more regimented and based on the overarching systems used in their areas of work. This reminded me of the reading about indigenous time systems, where life shifted to being more regimented as a measure of productivity rather than productive based on the needs at the current moment. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                To me, this is something I plan to take into the future as I often find myself worrying about not spending enough time on a particular project or deliverable or spending too much time on something else. This causes me a lot of anxiety and drains my energy as I tend to think about the metrics of what I am spending time on rather than the deliverable itself. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I felt like the parts I did well as a group member were contributing during the planning stages and during the interview stages. During this part of the project, I conducted five interviews, including one with my grandmother in a different language. This was difficult for me as I am not completely fluent in Tamil, and my grandmother is not fluent in English. I also felt like I did a good job asking follow up questions during my interviews and asking follow up questions to get more insights out of the interviewees 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Over the course of this project, I wish I had done a better job maintaining communication with the rest of my group and taking more initiative on the due deliverables. During this time, I had to handle a number of other personal and academic commitments and I felt like my attention was taken away from this class. However, at the end of the quarter, I was able to bring my attention back to this class and contribute to my team. 
            </p>
            <h2>Kayla</h2>
            <p>During the development and execution of our final project, Timeless Conversations, I learned the
                importance of asking questions while also being a listener. In our course, I gained immense knowledge of
                the idea of mutual learning, which is the process of sharing ideas, values, and backgrounds with one
                another and learning together. One quote from class that stuck with me was, “We're not empty vessels; we
                are going to learn from each other.” The strong sense of community and collaboration in our course
                sparked creativity, leading us to conduct interviews with people from different age ranges and
                backgrounds to learn about their experiences with time.</p>
            <p>As the primary topic of our design course was time, my group and I wanted to explore this idea even
                further and ask questions related to time to people who may have never thought deeply about it. Similar
                to the in-class questions we received every morning at the beginning of class, these simple questions
                related to the time allowed me to have a stronger understanding of how time affects our lives every day.
            </p>
            <p>During the podcast interview process, I interviewed four participants: two elementary school students,
                one college student, and one mother. Though my interview participants knew about the concepts of time,
                the interview questions allowed them to think more deeply about these simple questions. Gradually, as I
                asked more questions during the interviews, I was able to hear more raw and in-depth responses. These
                more in-depth responses meant to me that my interviewees were more comfortable with the idea of time.
            </p>
            <p>As a group member, I personally think I did well at coordinating with my team, opening up and sharing
                ideas, and also keeping our team on track. Because I was working with group members that I have known
                for a while now, it was easy to establish team goals and complete our project. Being a group member to
                me means taking initiative, keeping my group members engaged, and also making sure I am available to
                work with my team. What I can do better next time would be to be proactive in reminding myself and team
                members about project deliverables and creating clear goals at the beginning of a project.</p>
